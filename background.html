        <h3>My Background</h3>
        Currently Arizonan by location, still Californian by heart. 
        My grandfather worked with computers since my mother was a child, back in the days when cellphones were briefcases (and my grandfather even had one). 
        I spent summers as a child in his office, surrounded by half demolished motherboards.

        <h3>Developer Dreams</h3>
        I love solving problems which is common for coders. 
        I've seen many others talk about wnjoying seeing what they've built, and I enjoy that too, but in truth what makes me happiest is fixing what someone else built and is now broken. 
        There's something uniquely satisying about walking into a messy room and leaving it absolutely perfect. 
        My absolute favorite kind of logic puzzle.
